# Xylophone-App

Together with this Xylophone app, you can carry your Xylophone in your pocket. As you see in the photos, by pressing different buttons, you can listen different sounds and create your own music! I used apple AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer which are apple libraries to built the app. In addition, I benefited from Stakover Flow to find the best code which is appropriate for playing music in iPhone and iPad. Xylophone app is also suitable for different Iphone size, potrait and landscape layouts.
