# Xylophone-App

Together with this Xylophone app, you can carry your Xylophone in your pocket. As you see in the photos, by pressing different buttons, you can listen different sounds. I used apple AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer which are apple libraries. In addition, I benefited from Stakover Flow to find the best code appropriate for playing music in iPhone.
